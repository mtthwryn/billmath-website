BillMath is a Web Application which helps to proportionately determine each persons share of a total bill. This algorithm not only takes into account meals bought individually but also ones that are shared amongst subgroups. Each person's share is scaled according to any additional charges (service charge/kitchen fee etc) and tips to determine exactly how much of the total bill each person should pay. Users are able to automatically share a summary of the payment breakdown with in their group chats
