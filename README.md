# BillMath Website

BillMath is a Web Application which helps to proportionately determine each persons share of a total bill. This algorithm not only takes into account meals bought individually but also ones that are shared amongst subgroups. Each person's share is scaled according to any additional charges (service charge/kitchen fee etc) and tips to determine exactly how much of the total bill each person should pay. Users are able to share an automatically generated summary of the payment breakdown (detailing the total bill, who paid, and how much each person should transfer to the person who paid for the bill) with the people they shared the meal with
